# What is Qloud?

***Qloud*** is a web platform demonstrating some of the classic quantum algorithms.
It can simulate quantum computer on both quantum and classical hardwares.
[Microsoft Q#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/overview-what-is-qsharp-and-qdk) is the key to such capabilities.
Qloud can create quantum experiment tasks according to user input from the web side, and then do the simulations/experiments on its Q# backend.

# Features

## Supported Algorithms

Qloud has a support list for quantum algorithm:

- [ ] Shor
- [x] Grover

*An algorithm gets a tick means it has been supported; one without a tick yet still on the list means it's a TODO.*

# Deploy Qloud

TODO.
